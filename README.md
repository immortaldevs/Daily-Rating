##App Description
Daily Rating uses Android's brand new ultra-low power activity tracking abilities to track and analyze your daily activities. Thanks to this feature, Daily Rating has virtually ZERO impact on your phone's battery life. It constantly runs in the background, using as little processing power and battery as is possible on the Android system. More information about this low-power activity tracking can be found at http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2014/05/google-play-services-44.html

This app only collects meaningful data if you keep your phone in your hand or pocket as often as possible.

This app is completely free and open source. There are no ads or premium versions to buy. All of the source code for creating this app is available online at https://github.com/iozxllc/Daily-Rating
